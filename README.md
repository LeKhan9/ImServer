# ImServer
This is an implementation of a web server that serves html and image files in a non-persistent, non-parallel fashion.


The webpage contains a form using the post method. The authentication is cross-listed with a database of names and
passwords. An authenticated user will see a random image pop up on the screen, and the size of that image can be toggled
between large and small. Permissions for specific files are strictly controlled, and errors are handled.
